    <h1>Why does Milan love music?</h1>
    <p>Music is honestly a huge part of my life because it can change my whole mood in like two seconds. Whether I’m sad, mad, or happy, there’s always a song that just gets it. That’s why I love it so much, it’s like my personal escape from everything.</p>
    <h1>My Favorite Songs + why</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDh-5u9SRpk">"Close to you" by Dreezy ft. T.Pain</a>
            <ul>
                <li>This is my all-time favorite song. I gatekeep this song because I love it so much. It is the perfect late night song!</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EjZF88vqNU">"Sweet Thing" by Mary J. Blige</a>
            <ul>
                <li>This song always lifts up my spirits. It is a "happy" song! This is the song I go to when I am feeling down because as soon as I hear the first three notes of the guitar, it feels as if nothing else matters.</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PBZy9j3H3I">"Love" by Keyshia Cole</a>
            <ul>
                <li>It’s one of those songs you blast when you're in your feelings, and it never gets old. I've been singing this song with my heart since a kid!</li>
